The project is an Agentic AI-powered platform designed to assess employee satisfaction and well-being through intelligent automation.

It autonomously collects and analyzes employee feedback to detect emotional tone, stress level, and burnout risk.

The system demonstrates Agentic AI behavior by perceiving human input, reasoning contextually, and producing meaningful insights without manual supervision.

It incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret unstructured text feedback and understand human emotions and intent.

The AI engine transforms qualitative responses into measurable emotional insights, making complex psychological data easy to interpret.

It visually presents the analyzed data through interactive dashboards, charts, and sentiment distributions.

The visual analytics display patterns of positivity, negativity, and burnout levels across employees for easy HR interpretation.

The project integrates Agentic AI reasoning with NLP understanding and data visualization to create a complete well-being intelligence ecosystem.
